public interface IContract
{
    void Func1();
    void Func2();
}

/// <remarks>
/// Class is implementing Contarct "IContract"
/// This class represent the concrete implementation of one the client C1
/// requirement  
/// </remarks>
public class ConcreteImplementation1 : IContract
{

    public void Func1()
   {
      //..... Do something......
   }

    public void Func2()
   {
      //..... Do something......
   }
}

/// <remarks>
/// Class is implementing Contarct "IContract"
/// This class represent the concrete implementation of one the client C2
/// requirement  
/// </remarks>
public class ConcreteImplementation2 : IContract
{

    public void Func1()
   {
      //..... Do something......
   }

    public void Func2()
   {
      //..... Do something......
   }
}

Please carefully read above code where a real life problem has been described. In above scenario, a Contract has been followed by two of the Client and both Contract has something to achieve. Now after some time out of 2 client, one of the client want to have one more addition within his Contract.

How from you code you will facilitate "Client 2" request to add "Func3" without affecting "Client 1"?
